# Denver-Salary-Map

This map is a personal project for a Denver UI/UX Salary Survey that I helped to create and send out to the Denver UI/UX community.

index.html is where I am adding my heatmap layer to the map.

`salary_points.geojson` is the file I generated in QGIS from the survey data to display salaries of UX/UI designers in denver.

## Running It

`python3 -m http.server 8000` and then test by going to `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.
