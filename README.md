# Denver-Salary-Map

This map is a personal project for a Denver UI/UX Salary Survey that I helped to create and send out to the Denver UI/UX community.

index.html is where I am adding my heatmap layer to the map.

salary_points.geojson is the file I generated in QGIS from the survey data to display salaries of UX/UI designers in denver.
